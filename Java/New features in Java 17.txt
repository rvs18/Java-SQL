New features introduced in Java 17

Sealed Classes (Preview): Sealed classes and interfaces allow the restriction of which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them. This helps in creating more maintainable and reliable code by restricting inheritance.

Pattern Matching for switch (Standard): Enhanced switch expressions with pattern matching capabilities. It simplifies code by eliminating repetitive code for variable declaration and type casting.

Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator): The Foreign Function & Memory API, introduced as an incubator feature, provides a way to call native code and work with native memory from Java.

Deprecating and Removing APIs: Java 17 deprecates and removes several APIs, including the Applet API, Security Manager, RMI Activation, and others.

Sealed Classes in JDK: Certain JDK classes have been made sealed to improve security and maintainability.

Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals: More JDK internals have been strongly encapsulated to improve security and maintainability.

New macOS Rendering Pipeline: Java 17 introduces a new rendering pipeline for macOS, which is based on the Metal framework.

New Packaging Tool (Incubator): A new tool for packaging self-contained Java applications is introduced as an incubator feature. It aims to replace the existing jlink tool.

Remove Experimental AOT and JIT Compiler: The experimental Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which was introduced in Java 9, has been removed due to lack of adoption and maintenance burden.
